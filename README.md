# Quantum Chemistry with Kolmogorov Arnold Networks

Quantum neural networks have been shown to deliver exceptional performance as surrogate models for problems in many-body quantum systems. To predict electronic wavefunctions, ChemKAN finds the radial and angular functions that minimize the energy of the Schr√∂dinger Equation.
